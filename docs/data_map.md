# Data map

Version for 29 Oct 2026. Public dataset facts checked on the source pages on 24 and 25 Oct 2026; numbers in brackets refer to `docs/sources.md`.
Raw data is never committed; it lives in `data/` (git-ignored).

**Bottom line.** The concept is cracks in **buildings in slum-like, informal neighbourhoods** (`spec/decisions.md` D14). No public dataset shows those buildings with a crack, a scale reference and an engineer's rating. Public data can only pre-train the detector and the segmenter; the photos we collect with our partners are the real data and the critical path.

## 0. How close each dataset is to the concept

| Fit | Data | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Target** | Engineer-labelled phone photos from informal neighbourhoods (to collect with the partners) | The exact case: homes, phone photos, scale card, engineer rating |
| **High (closest public)** | Haiti 2010 Earthquake Database [41] | Engineers' photos of 183 real buildings in Port-au-Prince and Léogâne, reinforced concrete and concrete-block masonry, each rated light / moderate / severe with crack-based definitions; ratings are per building, after an earthquake, no scale |
| **High (closest public)** | 2015 Nepal Earthquake Building Performance Database [42] | 146 low-rise RC buildings with masonry infill in Kathmandu, photos, rated light / moderate / severe / collapse; per building, no scale |
| Medium | Building Surveys after Earthquakes (Nepal, Ecuador, Taiwan, Korea) [43] | Same kind of per-building engineer surveys with photos; non-commercial |
| Medium | Strathclyde brickwork cracks [44] | 700 brick facade images, crack / no crack; small |
| Medium | PHI-Net [26] | Real damaged buildings after earthquakes, with component and damage labels; not pre-failure cracks; non-commercial |
| Medium | Darbhanga brick masonry [30] | Brick walls, the material of many informal homes; one heritage fort, not homes |
| Medium | Dais et al. masonry masks [31] | Masonry walls with pixel masks; small |
| Medium | Pilot photos, Barcelona old facades | Real buildings and phone photos with the scale card; not informal settlements, no engineer |
| Low | METU concrete cracks [36] | Concrete walls of campus buildings; formal buildings, tiles only |
| Low | SDNET2018 walls subset [22] | Concrete walls, but of bridge-related structures; tiles only |
| Low | crack-seg [33], CrackSeg9k [25] | Mostly roads and pavement; generic pre-training for crack pixels only |
| **Off-concept** | CODEBRIM [28], SDNET2018 decks and pavement [22] | Bridges and roads, not buildings |

**Closest public data:** the post-earthquake building surveys from Haiti and Nepal [41][42]. Haiti on our disk: 183 buildings rated by engineers (reinforced concrete: 74 light, 27 moderate, 70 severe; masonry walls: 47 light, 25 moderate, 90 severe) and 4,450 photos, 95% of which pass our quality gate (1,041 of them linked to their building's rating; light, moderate and severe pass at the same rate). These surveys show real buildings in dense, poor neighbourhoods, photographed and rated by engineers. Their damage classes map onto our levels: light (no damage or hairline cracks), moderate (wider cracks or spalling), severe (see-through cracks, failure). Limits: one rating per building, not per crack; damage after an earthquake, not slow deterioration; no scale reference.

**Still missing:** per-crack photos with a scale from informal or self-built housing before any disaster. Only our own collection with the partners can give that.

### Gate result on the datasets we hold, in order of fit

![Quality gate on real images](../figures/08_real_data_quality_gate.png)

| # | Dataset | Fit to our concept | Accepted by the quality gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Haiti 2010 (engineer survey) | high | 95% |
| 2 | Darbhanga (brick masonry) | medium | 75% |
| 3 | Strathclyde (brick facades) | medium | 100% |
| 4 | PHI-Net task 8, damage type | medium | 78% (damaged 85%, undamaged 71%) |
| 5 | PHI-Net task 3, spalling | medium | 62% (spalling 66%, no spalling 57%) |
| 6 | PHI-Net task 6, components | medium | 79% |
| 7 | METU (building concrete) | low | 21% |
| 8 | SDNET2018 wall | low | 16% |
| 9 | crack-seg (roads, walls) | low | 97% |
| 10 | SDNET2018 pavement | off-concept | 87% |
| 11 | SDNET2018 bridge deck | off-concept | 19% |

"Accepted" counts cracked and uncracked images together (up to 2,000 per group, last run on 27 Oct 2026); the split is in `docs/experiments/2026-10-25_quality_gate_first_test.md`. A low share means the gate struggles with that surface (smooth plaster and concrete, D12), not that the data is bad.
PHI-Net images are 224 x 224 px crops, measured as they are (the gate scales large photos down to 512 px and never scales up). About a quarter of them fall under the blur limit. Why is not checked yet: look at the rejected ones before training.

### Every dataset we hold, side by side (27 Oct 2026)

![Every dataset we hold, compared](../figures/10_dataset_comparison.png)

One row per dataset (one per PHI-Net task), in order of fit: images on our disk, share accepted by the quality gate, the labels it gives, what it can train in our pipeline, and the licence. PHI-Net went through the gate for the three tasks we plan to train on (3, 6, 8); the other tasks were not run. Details of PHI-Net on our disk are in section 6.

## 0b. What we can train now, and what we cannot (25 Oct 2026)

| Step | Enough data now? | What we have | What is missing | How we get it |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Find crack pixels (U-Net) | **Yes** | CrackSeg9k and crack-seg: about 13,000 images with crack outlines | Plaster and brick walls of homes are rare in them | Pre-train on these, fine-tune on our own photos |
| Detect cracks (YOLO) | **Yes, for cracks** | Darbhanga crack boxes on brick walls, crack-seg polygons | Boxes for the element (column, beam, slab, wall) | Draw element boxes on our own photos |
| Crack or no crack | **Yes** | METU, Strathclyde, SDNET2018: over 90,000 images | Smooth plaster walls of homes | Our pilot photos |
| Crack pattern (7 classes) | **No** | No dataset uses our seven patterns | Labels | Label a few hundred images by hand (number: assumption, to set when we start) |
| Width in mm | **No** | Nothing public has a scale reference | Photos with the scale card and a known width | Pilot photos with the scale card |
| Low / Medium / High | **No** | Haiti and Nepal rate whole buildings, after an earthquake | A rating per crack, by an engineer | Our photos rated by Engineers Without Borders and the structural engineer |
| Proof that the tool works (3 Dec baseline) | **No** | Nothing | Held-out photos rated per crack, plus an engineer's photo-only rating | Same as above; at least 30 High cases (`spec/features/evaluation.md`) |

**In one line:** we can train the "find the crack" step now (hackathon target); the "how dangerous is it" step, and the proof that it works, still depend on our own photos and the engineers (`spec/decisions.md` D15).

## 1. What each pipeline stage needs, and where it comes from

![Data coverage](../figures/05_data_coverage.png)

| Stage | Needs | Covered by | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Quality gate | Phone photos labelled usable / unusable (blur, light, scale card visible) | Pilot photos (section 4), planned. First code test on five public sets done (`docs/experiments/2026-10-25_quality_gate_first_test.md`) | Public sets are not phone photos; they test the code only |
| Material model (O scale) | Images labelled concrete / not concrete; residents cannot tell (D25) | Concrete: METU, SDNET2018, CODEBRIM; not concrete: Darbhanga and Strathclyde brick, Dais masonry. PHI-Net's material task is steel vs other materials, so it does not separate concrete from brick [55] | Plaster and paint hide the material; our phone photos needed |
| Element model (O scale) | Photos of whole elements labelled column, beam, slab, wall; residents cannot tell (D25) | PHI-Net task 6, component type: beam, column, wall, others (research licence) [55] | Slab is not a separate PHI-Net class; our photos needed |
| Crack segmentation (P scale) | Pixel masks of cracks | CrackSeg9k [25]; crack-seg polygons converted to masks [33]; Dais et al. masonry masks [31] | Few columns and beams |
| Measurement (P scale) | Crack width in mm with a scale reference | Pilot photos with the printed scale card, planned (`spec/features/photo_protocol.md`) | Nothing public has a scale reference |
| Pattern model (P scale) | Labels for the 7 reinforced-concrete patterns (`spec/features/risk_matrix.md`) | Partly: PHI-Net task 8, damage type (flexural, shear, combined) and task 3, spalling [55]; CODEBRIM spalling, exposed bars, corrosion stains for `spalling_exposed_bar` [28] | Surface map, along-bar, column-horizontal and joint cracks need our own labels |
| Building risk score (S scale) | Age, floors added, structure or use changed, open ground floor (`spec/features/building_score.md`) | Resident and field-worker questionnaire; candidates for map data in section 2 | No public record of added floors or changes in informal areas |
| Agent (building data) | Construction type, age, footprint | Candidates in section 2 | Source not chosen; access not agreed |
| Triage rules | Signed-off matrix and thresholds | Illustrative matrix (`spec/features/triage.md`) | Engineer sign-off (Phase 1) |
| Evaluation | On-site engineer rating per crack (ground truth) and an engineer's photo-only rating (baseline) | Nothing yet | Engineering partner (`spec/features/evaluation.md`) |

### Our own data

| Data | Source | Availability | Access | Format | Size | Licence | Covers | Gaps |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pilot phone photos (no engineer) | Us, Barcelona, public facades (`spec/features/photo_protocol.md`) | To collect this week | Our own; no people, no addresses | S, O and P photos with the scale card; labels in a CSV | Target about 30 cracks, 3 shots each (assumption) | Ours | Photo protocol, quality gate, width measurement | No risk labels; Barcelona is not the target context |
| Engineer-labelled phone photos | To collect (Phase 2) | Does not exist | Needs engineering partner and resident consent | Same protocol, plus element, material, pattern, width (mm), Low / Medium / High, on-site rating | Target size: assumption, to set with the partner | Ours; consent rules to write | The real target data | Everything: partner, consent, sites |

### Building data and ground-truth candidates

No validation site is chosen: the architecture is general. Places named in the problem statement (for example Tripoli) are motivating examples only, not data or validation sites (`spec/decisions.md` D26).

| Data | Source | Availability | Access | Format | Size | Licence | Covers | Gaps |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| BUET factory survey, Dhaka | Reported by AFP, The Daily Star [16][17] | Reported; raw survey not found | Ask BUET (assumption) | Unknown | Unknown | Unknown | Engineer assessments of factory buildings | Frames, Phase 3; old (2013) |
| Building database for the agent (construction type, footprint) | Not chosen | - | Over MCP (planned) | To define | - | - | Context for the agent | Source, schema and access all open |

## 3. Not usable as data
- Example photos in the deck (slide 8): stock images, authors not identified; their risk labels are a visual guess.
- Kaggle "Crack Dataset" (yatata1, CC BY-SA 4.0, 13.8 GB, "under development") [37]: checked 25 Oct, not used. Its description says it was assembled from existing public crack sets (Rissbilder, the Kaggle "Crack Segmentation Dataset") and UAV infrastructure inspections, so it overlaps CrackSeg9k; mostly concrete and asphalt, off-concept (D14).
- Kaggle "Crack Detection/Classification Dataset" (Apache 2.0 as labelled by the uploader, about 20 GB, v1 Aug 2026) [38]: checked 25 Oct, not used. Nine mixed domains (roads, metal, car bodies, wood, circuit boards, welding, synthetic concrete); only `Wall_Concrete` is near the concept, and it mixes walls with bridges. The sources it aggregates are not named, so provenance and licence cannot be traced.
- Kaggle "Building Crack Detection Dataset" (CC0 as labelled by the uploader, v1 Jul 2026) [39]: checked 25 Oct, not used. Only 51 images (17 hairline, 17 irregular, 17 wide cracks), no uncracked images despite the description, no scale, and no stated source for the photos.
- Kaggle "Satellite Imagery Data for Haiti" (Techsalerator) [40]: checked 25 Oct, not used. A vendor listing: the 1.3 MB download holds another company's real-estate sample files and one image, no satellite imagery; the full data is on request. Satellite images cannot show wall cracks anyway; at most they could locate informal neighbourhoods for the agent.
- Case-study figures (deaths, evacuations): context for the problem, not training data.

## 4. Plan, in order
1. **First test on real data (29 Oct): done** on crack-seg, Darbhanga and SDNET2018 (`docs/experiments/2026-10-25_quality_gate_first_test.md`). It found and fixed a resolution bug in the blur check, and showed that the blur check confuses smooth walls with blur (D12). Tests the code, not the thresholds.
2. **U-Net pre-training:** CrackSeg9k for generic crack pixels, then fine-tune on masonry (Dais et al., if their image terms allow it) and on our own building photos.
3. **Building-like data first:** Haiti and Nepal engineer surveys (real buildings, engineer ratings), then Darbhanga and Strathclyde (brick), PHI-Net (damaged buildings), METU (building concrete). CODEBRIM is off-concept (bridges): use it only if no building photos of spalling with rust turn up.
4. **Find informal-housing crack photos:** post-disaster housing surveys, reconnaissance photo sets, shelter assessments (section 0).
5. **Pilot photos this week:** about 30 cracks on public facades in Barcelona, following `spec/features/photo_protocol.md`. Tests the protocol and gives the quality gate real phone photos.
6. **Engineering partners, now:** Engineers Without Borders and a third-party structural engineer (agreement under construction) for labelled photos, baseline ratings and sign-off. Everything in Phase 2 waits on this.

## 5. Open items
- Consent and data rules for Phase 2: the deck says "photos stay with the household"; labelling needs copies. Write who keeps what, for how long, and how faces and addresses are removed.
- Licences: PHI-Net and CODEBRIM are non-commercial (`spec/decisions.md` D6).
- Confirm the Dais image terms with the authors.
- Confirm the Haiti database licence before using any photo in slides or training (email drafted 25 Oct). The archive's contact is santiago.pujol@canterbury.ac.nz, subject "datacenterhub inquiry" [45]; ask in the same email about the Türkiye 2023 (ACI 133) survey, whose link returned an empty file.
- Nepal 2015: download only the Nepal folder in a browser into `data/raw/nepal2015/`.
- Pick a threshold for the CrackSeg9k soft masks; find the masonry subset's file prefix.
- Ultralytics (YOLO) software is AGPL-3.0 (`spec/decisions.md` D9).

## 6. Local copies (`data/raw/`, never on GitHub)
What is downloaded on Jerome's PC as of 25 Oct 2026. Anyone else downloads from the source (section 2) into the same folder names.

| Folder | Dataset | On disk | Images | Download check |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `crack-seg/` | Ultralytics crack-seg [33] | 218 MB | 4,029 | Counted in the zip |
| `darbhanga/` | Brick masonry, Darbhanga [30] | 708 MB | 4,259 | SHA-256 matches Mendeley |
| `metu/` | METU concrete cracks [36] | 556 MB | 40,000 | SHA-256 matches Mendeley |
| `sdnet2018/` | SDNET2018 [22] | 629 MB | 56,092 | Downloaded in a browser; file sizes checked |
| `strathclyde-brickwork/` | Brickwork cracks [44] | 19 MB | 700 | MD5 matches Zenodo |
| `crackseg9k/` | CrackSeg9k Vol1 [25] | 1.5 GB | not extracted | MD5 matches Dataverse |
| `haiti2010/` | Haiti Earthquake Database [41] | 12 GB extracted (broken zip deleted) | 4,450 photos (1,041 linked to a building rating); spreadsheet of 183 buildings | Partial zip, every recovered file CRC-checked |
| `phinet/` | PHI-Net, 8 tasks [53][54][55] | 19 GB (zips 9.0 GB + uint8 arrays) | 73,530 image-label pairs over 8 tasks; PHI-Net reports 36,413 images in all [26], so tasks likely reuse images (assumption, not checked) | Zip sizes match the server; every zip passed its CRC check |
| `nepal2015/` | Nepal 2015 surveys [42] | - | not downloaded | Nepal folder to download in a browser |

Run the real-data test on all of them: `py src/experiments/real_data_quality.py data/raw/crack-seg data/raw/darbhanga data/raw/metu data/raw/sdnet2018 data/raw/strathclyde-brickwork --per-group 2000`.

### PHI-Net on our disk (27 Oct 2026)

`data/raw/phinet/zips/` holds the ten task zips as downloaded from the PEER download page [55] (`task1` and `task2` come in two parts). `py -I src/experiments/phinet_prepare.py data/raw/phinet/zips data/raw/phinet` turns each into `data/raw/phinet/<task>/` with:
- `X_train.npy`, `X_test.npy`: 224 x 224 RGB images as uint8. The zips store float32 BGR with the ImageNet mean subtracted (VGG preprocessing); the script undoes it, losslessly after rounding, which cuts the size by four.
- `y_train.npy`, `y_test.npy`: class numbers (the zips store one-hot rows).
- `README.txt` (label codes) and `license.txt` (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, research use only, D6).
- `data/raw/phinet/samples/<task>_<split>.png`: six random images per class, to look at before training. They stay in `data/`, never on GitHub.

| Task | Classes (code: name) | Train | Test | Train per class | Use for us |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 scene level (2 zips) | 0 object, 1 pixel, 2 structural | 24,309 | 2,997 | 8,111 / 7,690 / 8,508 | Scene check (S, O, P) |
| 2 damage state (2 zips) | 0 damaged, 1 undamaged | 11,811 | 1,460 | 6,282 / 5,529 | Crack or no crack |
| 3 spalling | 0 non-spalling, 1 spalling | 6,898 | 837 | 4,294 / 2,604 | Pattern: spalling |
| 4 material | 0 other materials, 1 steel | 8,312 | 979 | 6,506 / 1,806 | Not the material model: steel vs other, not concrete vs brick |
| 5 collapse mode | 0 global, 1 non-collapse, 2 partial | 1,226 | 146 | 525 / 322 / 379 | Building reading (S) |
| 6 component | 0 beam, 1 column, 2 others, 3 wall | 4,755 | 579 | 511 / 1,618 / 358 / 2,268 | Element model; no slab class |
| 7 damage level | 0 heavy, 1 minor, 2 moderate, 3 undamaged | 4,138 | 498 | 919 / 869 / 799 / 1,551 | Second opinion only |
| 8 damage type | 0 combined, 1 flexural, 2 undamaged, 3 shear | 4,093 | 492 | 1,193 / 476 / 1,598 / 826 | Pattern model |

Counts are from the npy files, not the paper.

What we saw in the sample sheets: PHI-Net mixes real buildings, close-ups and laboratory test specimens, and its spalling and damage classes include brick walls, and its column class includes timber columns. Before training for our concrete-only scope (D17), we filter or relabel by hand; the size of that filtered set is not known yet.
