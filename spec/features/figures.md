# Feature: figures (`src/viz/figures.py`)

Status: implemented. Run `py src/viz/figures.py` from the repository root; PNGs go to `figures/`.

Every figure is drawn from the repo's own rules and data map, so it changes when they change. None shows a measured result.

| File | Shows | Drawn from |
|---|---|---|
| `01_pipeline.png` | Pipeline v3: three scales (S, O, P as in PHI-Net task 1) x five phases, scene check, monitoring and learning loops, status of each box | `spec/features/pipeline.md` |
| `01b_pipeline_flow.png` | Step 0, report and dispatch (when a field worker visits: V1, V2, V3, D27), then the same pipeline v3 drawn as a task flow: phases as numbered columns, scales as lanes; diamonds for written checks with stop (Retake, Expert needed) and continue marks, stacked boxes for learned models, both loops. Black, white and grey only: white = photos and people, grey = written rules (code), black = learned models | `spec/features/pipeline.md`, `spec/features/dispatch.md` |
| `02_decisions_and_players.png` | Decisions and players: the five players as lifelines, time going down, 14 numbered hand-offs, each with a symbol and one word (key below); decisions only on the written rules and the engineer; a 'who decides what' panel. Black, white and grey | `triage.dispatch.screen()`, `triage.matrix.assess()`, `spec/features/building_score.md` |
| `03_risk_matrix.png` | Matrix v3 in black, white and grey: each crack pattern as a drawn symbol with one word (key below), base category per pattern x width band (Category 1 white, 2 grey, 3 black), and what raises it, in words, with new and assumed values tagged | `src/triage/risk_matrix_v3.json` (read at run time) |
| `04_segmentation_tree.png` | Tree v3: crack path (yellow) into the atomic problem, building path (navy) into the building risk score, context (grey); scale badge and evidence under each node | `docs/segmentation_tree.md` |
| `05_data_coverage.png` | Which data source feeds which pipeline stage, by scale | `docs/data_map.md`, section 1 |
| `06_dataset_sizes.png` | What we found, and how it could help: image counts and licences of every dataset and of our own data, and what each can be used for: train a model, test a model or the quality gate, measure crack widths in mm (only photos with a scale); black and white | `docs/data_map.md`, sections 0b, 1, 2 and 6 |
| `07_confusion_template.png` | TP / FN / FP / TN and the full 3 x 5 confusion matrix, no counts | `spec/features/evaluation.md` |
| `08_real_data_quality_gate.png` | Sharpness of public dataset images against the blur limit (made by `src/experiments/real_data_quality.py`, not by this script) | Haiti 2010, Darbhanga, Strathclyde, PHI-Net tasks 8, 3 and 6, METU, SDNET2018, crack-seg; panels ordered by fit to the concept |
| `09_timeline.png` | Plan to the final presentation (17 Dec) with syllabus milestones and tasks at risk | `spec/constitution/roadmap.md` |
| `10_dataset_comparison.png` | Every dataset on our disk side by side, in order of fit: images, quality gate pass rate, labels, what it trains, licence; one row per PHI-Net task | `docs/data_map.md`, sections 0 and 6; gate rates from `data/processed/real_data_quality.csv` |
| `11_pattern_examples.png` | Real examples: up to three real photos of each crack pattern of the risk matrix, in the matrix's order and design (symbol + one word); each photo credited; engineer label or team pick per column. **Local only (git-ignored):** the photos keep their own licences (PHI-Net CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, Wikimedia Commons) | `src/viz/pattern_examples.py` (needs `data/raw/phinet`) |

Colour rules: flow figures (01b, 02) and the matrix (03) use black, white and grey only: white = photos and people, grey = written rules, black = learned models; in the matrix, Category 1 white, 2 grey, 3 black, always with the number. Older figures (07, 09) still use the status colours, always with a text label; coverage uses one blue ramp.

When `docs/` changes, update the data constants in `figures.py` (TREE, COVERAGE, DATASETS, HELD, PLAN, MILESTONES) and rerun.
Later, once engineer-labelled photos exist: a filled confusion matrix and the measured threshold curve (missed Category 3 vs referral rate).

## Symbol key of the risk matrix (`03_risk_matrix.png`)
The seven crack patterns are drawn as symbols, each with one word; everything else on the figure is in words.

| Symbol | Word | Pattern |
|---|---|---|
| Network of fine cracks on a panel | Map | surface map cracking |
| Beam with short vertical cracks from the bottom | Bending | flexural crack |
| Beam with a diagonal crack near its support | Shear | diagonal shear crack |
| Crack running over a dashed bar | Bar | crack along a bar |
| Column with horizontal cracks | Column | horizontal crack in a column |
| Missing patch with a bar showing | Spalling | spalling with exposed bar |
| Cross of beam and column with an X at the joint | Joint | beam-column joint crack |

## Arrow key of decisions and players (`02_decisions_and_players.png`)
Each arrow shows its step number, a symbol and one word; the full meaning is here.

| # | Symbol | Word | From → to | What passes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | camera | Report | resident → app models | photo of the crack + answers |
| 2 | ruler | Measure | app models → app written rules | crack found? rough width · confidence |
| 3 | clock | Wait | app written rules → resident | Retake, or V3: not assessed yet, recheck in 1 month |
| 4 | house | Visit | app written rules → field worker | V1: visit within 1 week · V2: within 1 month |
| 5 | bell | Alert | app written rules → engineer | V1 only: the engineer is told the same day |
| 6 | clipboard | Survey | field worker → resident | asks the building questions, places stickers + crack ID |
| 7 | camera | Photos | field worker → app models | reliable photos: the building, every cracked element, every crack |
| 8 | bar chart | Readings | app models → app written rules | material, element, width, pattern + confidence |
| 9 | pencil | Pattern | field worker → app written rules | pattern picked from drawings while the model is unsure |
| 10 | document | Result | app written rules → resident | Category 1 or 2: level, reason, recheck date |
| 11 | warning triangle | Escalate | app written rules → engineer | Category 3, Expert needed (any doubt), buildings P1 · P2 |
| 12 | check mark | Confirmed | engineer → resident | confirmed level, reason, next step · never 'safe' |
| 13 | stacked layers | Retrain | engineer → app models | corrections become labels → retraining |
| 14 | calendar | Recheck | resident → app models | recheck photo of the same crack ID → back to step 8 |
