# Second Look

Second Look is a human-in-the-loop triage system for cracks in reinforced concrete. It checks the photo and the material, finds and measures the crack in millimetres, classifies its pattern, and applies written, auditable risk rules, returning a level with its confidence. An engineer confirms every Category 3 and every referral, and their corrections retrain the models. It never issues a safety clearance.

## Problem
Residents of old buildings see cracks every day but cannot tell a harmless one from a sign of structural failure, and engineers are too few to inspect every building.
Tripoli, February 2026: two blocks collapsed on 8 February (14 to 15 dead, per AFP and Reuters), and 114 buildings were ordered evacuated.
Rana Plaza, Dhaka, 2013: cracks were visible the day before the collapse.

## What it does
The unit is the **building**, photographed at three scales as in PHI-Net: **S** the building, **O** the element, **P** the crack.
- **S:** a short building questionnaire (age, storeys, floors added, typology and its changes) and a facade photo give a **building risk score** that ranks buildings for engineers (P1, P2, P3).
- **O:** models identify the **material** (concrete or not) and the **element** (column, beam, slab, wall); residents are never asked.
- **P:** the crack close-up with a printed scale card is checked (sharp, at least 3 pixels across the crack), segmented and measured (width in mm with its uncertainty); the written risk matrix gives Category 1, Category 2, Category 3, "Expert needed" or "Retake", each with its confidence and a one-sentence reason.
- **Monitoring:** the same crack is photographed again on its recheck date; growth larger than the measurement uncertainty raises its level.
- **Engineers** review every Category 3 and every referral; their corrections retrain the models (human-in-the-loop learning).

Full pipeline: `spec/features/pipeline.md` and `figures/01_pipeline.png`.
It never gives a permit or a clearance. Any doubt goes to an expert, and an engineer confirms every Category 3.

## Data
The concept is cracks in buildings in slum-like, informal neighbourhoods. See `docs/data_map.md`: every source is ranked by how close it is to that case.
- Closest public data: engineer surveys of damaged buildings after the Haiti 2010 and Nepal 2015 earthquakes, rated light / moderate / severe (one rating per building, no scale).
- Building and masonry crack images: METU, Darbhanga, Strathclyde (crack / no crack, no scale).
- Generic crack pixels for pre-training: CrackSeg9k, crack-seg. Bridge and pavement sets are off-concept.
- Still to collect: our own phone photos with the printed scale card, rated by our engineering partners (Engineers Without Borders and a third-party structural engineer).

**Can we train with it?** Partly. There is enough public data to train the step that finds cracks (segmentation and detection). There is not enough to train or prove the step that rates danger: no public dataset has our seven crack patterns, a scale for width in mm, or an engineer's rating per crack. Those come only from our own photos and the engineering partners (`docs/data_map.md`, section 0b).

Raw data is not committed; `data/` stays empty in the repository.

## Method and status
The risk matrix and decision rules are implemented in `src/triage/` with tests, and so is the dispatch rule that decides when a field worker visits after a resident's report (`spec/features/dispatch.md`, D27). Thresholds are illustrative until calibrated with a structural engineer.
The confusion tables (true and false positives and negatives, with missed Category 3 as the key error) are defined in `spec/features/evaluation.md` and coded in `src/triage/evaluate.py`.
The quality gate (`src/quality/`) ran as a first test on real images from five public datasets. It found and fixed a resolution bug in the blur check, and showed that the blur check confuses smooth plaster and concrete with blur (open, decision D12) (`docs/experiments/`).
Models are not trained yet. Decisions are logged in `spec/decisions.md`. The plan to the final presentation (17 Dec) is in `spec/constitution/roadmap.md`; this week's tasks in `docs/weekly_todo.md`.

## Results
None yet. Success means beating the non-AI baseline (an engineer's visual check) on held-out, engineer-labelled photos, while missing almost no Category 3 cases (a target, not a result).
We stop or redesign if the tool misses Category 3 cases that engineers would flag.

## Limitations
A surface photo cannot show rebar, concrete strength or foundations. Concrete and brick crack differently and need separate data.
Public crack data is mostly concrete and pavement.
